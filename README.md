Bash automation scripts for my computer. I write these as cross compatible as possible across linux systems. These scripts have notes at the top of them with simple instructions such as what environmental variables to set. These scripts use the bash interpretor (/bin/bash).

If you do not like the .sh extension you can simple do `mv script-name.sh script-name` because of the #!/bin/bash at the top of every script
